0.3
  - Added favicon
  - Changed readme.txt: ufw2web is dependent from python-cherrypy3 and
    not python-cherrypy (actually: version 2.x)
  - Added extra config parameter: 'server.socket_host':'0.0.0.0'
    In some cases, the server was not reachable from the outside
  - Simplified status checking: see if 'not loaded' is in the return string
    This was needed to obtain compatability with Hardy, which is using on older
    version of ufw. Status returned by Hardy was 'Firewall not loaded' instead 
    of 'Status: not loaded' in Intrepid and higher.
  - ConfigFolder is now based defined as an absolute path to provide startup
    in an init-system

0.2 
  - Added authentication, default admin/admin
    - highly configurable, see config/ufw2web.conf for details
  - Changed structure of ufw2web.conf, not containing directory configuration anymore
    - refacored (reading of) settings
  - Autoredirect to main page for result pages (removed OK button)
  - Moved all config files to ./config (including translations)
  - Reading config files is more robust when keys do not exist
  - Use string formatting (code refactoring)
